### About the Project
This project is my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences in a clean and professional manner. Utilizing modern web development framework like ReactJS along with Bootstrap, I aim to create an intuitive and visually appealing platform where visitors can learn more about me, my work, and how to get in touch. Whether you're a potential employer, collaborator, or just curious about my background, this website serves as a comprehensive overview of my capabilities and achievements.

The website features sections about me, my projects, blogs, events, positions in communities and much more. It also has an option to view my resume and has various options in order to get in touch with me.
